Movie Recommendation System for Professional Data Science Capstone1 Harvard University

Recommendation systems plays an important role in e-commerce and online streaming services, such as
Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, etc. Making the right recommendation for the next product/service, music
or movie increases user retention and satisfaction, leading to product/service sales, thus increasing profit
growth. Companies competing for customer loyalty invest on recommendation systems that capture and
analyze the user’s preferences, and offer products/services with higher likelihood of purchase.

The economic impact of such company-customer relationship is very clear. Amazon is the largest online
retail company by sales and part of its success comes from the recommendation systems and marketing
based on user preferences. In 2006 Netflix offered a one million dollar prize for the person or group that
could improve their recommendation system by at least 10%.

Most recommendation systems are based on a rating scale from 1 to 5 grades or stars, with 1 indicating
lowest satisfaction and 5 is the highest satisfaction. Other indicators can also be used, such as comments
posted on previously used items; videos, musics or links shared with friends; percentage of movie watched or
music listened; web pages visited and time spent on each page; product category; and any other interactions
with the company’s web site or application can be used as a predictor.

The primary goal of recommendation systems is to help users find what they want based on their preferences
and previous interactions, and predicting the rating for a new item. In this document, we create a movie
recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset and applying the courses/lessons learned during the
HarvardX’s Data Science Professional Certificate program.

This document is structured as follows: 
Chapter 1 describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed. 
Chapter 2 we explain the method, process and techniques used, such as data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, any insights gained, and the modeling approach.
Chapter 3 we present the modeling analysis. 
Chapter 4 We discuss the results and model performance.
Chapter 5 We conclude with a brief summary of the report, its limitations and future work.

The goal of this movielens project is to predict the movie ratings by users as close as the true ratings in the
validation set using RMSE. Our goal is to get our final predicted RMSE < 0.86490
